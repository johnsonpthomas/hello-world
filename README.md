General Repository to add other stuff

My name is Johnson. I started my career as a Web Developer but go an oppourtunity to be an ETL Developer soon.
I have been working with different DataWarehouse projects since then mostly as an ETL Developer.
I have also worked as a BI Developer. Currently I am looking to move from GUI based applications to scripting preferably using Python.
